Semantic Breadcrumb Links (a.k.a. SBL) is a [Semantic Mediawiki][smw] extension
to aid in-page navigation by building breadcrumb links from an attributive property
filter.

SBL uses a pattern match strategy to filter property usage (e.g. `Has parent page`)
that ascribe the location of a page relative to its parent and provides navigational help by
generating a breadcrumb trail.

This [video](https://vimeo.com/129347298) demonstrates the functionality of the Semantic Breadcrumb Links extension.

## Requirements

- PHP 5.6 or later
- MediaWiki 1.27 or later
- [Semantic MediaWiki][smw] 2.5 or later

## Installation

The recommended way to install Semantic Breadcrumb Links is using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) with
[MediaWiki's built-in support for Composer](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Composer).

Note that the required extension Semantic MediaWiki must be installed first according to the installation
instructions provided.

### Step 1

Change to the base directory of your MediaWiki installation. This is where the "LocalSettings.php"
file is located. If you have not yet installed Composer do it now by running the following command
in your shell:

    wget https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar

### Step 2
    
If you do not have a "composer.local.json" file yet, create one and add the following content to it:

```
{
	"require": {
		"mediawiki/semantic-breadcrumb-links": "~2.0"
	}
}
```

If you already have a "composer.local.json" file add the following line to the end of the "require"
section in your file:

    "mediawiki/semantic-breadcrumb-links": "~2.0"

Remember to add a comma to the end of the preceding line in this section.

### Step 3

Run the following command in your shell:

    php composer.phar update --no-dev

Note if you have Git installed on your system add the `--prefer-source` flag to the above command. Also
note that it may be necessary to run this command twice. If unsure do it twice right away.

### Step 4

Add the following line to the end of your "LocalSettings.php" file:

    wfLoadExtension( 'SemanticBreadcrumbLinks' );

### Verify installation success

As final step, you can verify SCI got installed by looking at the "Special:Version" page on your wiki and
check that it is listed in the semantic extensions section.
